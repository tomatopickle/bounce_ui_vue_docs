# App

The `app` component is used to wrap the entire app.For now, it doesn't do much.


## Slots

This component has two slots,`append` and `prepend`. As the name suggests each are used to put elements on the left and right side of the app. For example, you can use the [sidebar](/bounce_ui_vue_docs/components/Sidebar) component in these slots.
